TFT Board Strength Calculator

# TLDR 
Casual project for developing a neural network (Transformer + FC MLP) which takes as input two TFT boards and outputs a probability of the 1st board winning (0 - 1). The reason for doing a pairwise win probability rather than single board strength score is b/c often outcomes are matchup dependent (rock-paper-scissors).
